# Knowledge Representation Project

This project demonstrates the concept of knowledge representation by associating fictional characters from the *Harry Potter* universe with their respective Hogwarts houses. It outputs character names along with their associated houses using a simple script.

## About the Project

The goal of this project is to explore basic principles of knowledge representation in computer science by organizing data in a way that makes logical relationships clear. We’ve used well-known characters and Hogwarts houses from *Harry Potter* to illustrate this, associating each character with a house.

**Example Output:**
```
GilderoyRavenclaw
PomonaHufflepuff
MinervaGryffindor
HoraceSlytherin
```

This output shows each character's first name followed by their associated Hogwarts house.

## Getting Started
